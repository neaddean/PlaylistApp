Project PlaylistApp
===================


Create a popular playlist application that accepts song playlists along with their
popularities, stores the most popular 1024 playlists, and i) suggests playlists
given a song and ii) suggests songs when the user starts typing a song name.
	 	 
The playlist application should support the following operations:
	 	 
- loading of at most 128 playlists along with their popularities 
as a text file: the format of the text file will be, in each line  
`<Playlist \t Popularity(integer)>` where
`Playlist` is a space separated list of song names and there 
are 128 or less lines in
the file. Note that if the number of playlists exceeds 1024, your system should
remove the least popular playlists to keep the size in 1024.
	 	 
- loading of a single playlist along with its popularity through a 
form page: Your app will have a page/tab with a form that enables 
addition of a single playlist along with its popularity to your 
popular playlist store. Note that if the number of
playlists exceeds 1024, your system should remove the least 
popular playlists to keep the size in 1024.
	 	 
- listing top 8 most popular playlists: Display the most popular 8 playlists to the
user.
	 	 
- given a song, suggest the most popular playlist that song is in.
	 	 
- as the user starts typing a song-name, the system should start suggesting four
song names based on the popularity of the songs. The popularity of a song is the
sum of the popularities of the playlists it is listed in. Note that as new playlists are
added, popularities of songs change as well.
	 	
An example song auto-completion is as follows: As the user types “all”, the
system suggests “all of me”, “all about the bass”, “all along the watchtower”, “all
that remains” as these four are the most popular songs that start with the
characters “all”, but as the user types “all o” the suggestions are now “all of me”,
“all of me loves all of you”, “all of my life”, “all of the stars” as now these four are
the most popular songs that start with the characters (have the prefix) “all o”.
	 	 

You are free to use any data structures you like for storing the songs, the
playlists, etc. But you must define the complexity of each functionality in your
system, e.g. loading the playlists, listing top playlists, retrieving playlists, 
autocompleting/suggesting songs, maintaining song/playlist popularities etc.

Efficient data structure selection & usage will get higher points.


Project Milestones 

- Develop a GUI that can load playlists both from a text file and through your UI, 
and then list the most popular 8 playlists.

- Completed project that supports all desired operations.
